/**
my submission notes
1. I didn't understand what even the syntax of scanf meant
2. u write the syntax code for respective data type like "%d" for int;  "%ld" for long inside double quotes
   then you have to write the respective variable for which you allocate your input into
3. https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_scanf.htm    for more info on the subject
4. messed up the printf syntax as well. there was basically no understanding for me on matter of "how to add a newline in between the outputs"
   and "how to selectively choose how much digits of precision you need in your double or float output"
5. spent 30 mins figuring out how to solve this on a shitty youtube tutorial of a guy with a big ass monitor and small font

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Complete the code.
    int i;
    long l;
    char c;
    float f;
    double d;
    scanf("%d %ld %c %f %lf" , &i, &l, &c, &f, &d);
    printf("%d\n%ld\n%c\n%.3f\n%.9lf\n", i,l,c,f,d);

    return 0;
}


//this is what my submission looked like, its literally the copy of editorial, but i had the exact same variable names in my mind as well
//i messed in line 24, wrote "&lf" instead of "%lf" , got really confused and frustrated
//apparently, you shouldn't give spaces after writing the "\n", it just messes up the code (its wrong basically)
//now i am depressed, i should go do my homework
